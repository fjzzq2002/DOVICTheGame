2. Dovic is a infectious disease that can spread from people to people. It has an incubation period of about 3 hours, during which one is infected but cannot infect others. In the next about 3 hours, one has no symptoms but could infect others. 

   Then one will experience the symptoms of being blue and unable to walk straight, and it takes about 12 hours to recover.

3. One of the student is the superspreader, who is infected at the beginning and wants to infect more people. Superspreader will win if at least 6 cases are reported or more than 2 other students fail to graduate within time.

5. To graduate, you need to finish 5 psets within 7 days. 

   You could get a new pset by attending a lecture in the central hall and answering the lecture questions.

6. You can sit down at any table to do the pset, which consists of many hard math problems!

   Students at the same table will do the pset together: all their psets will progress when any of them solves a problem.

   Seems to be irrelevant to lecture questions, right? 

   That's part of the feature. 

7. Each pset is due before the next lecture. You must finish this pset to get the next one.
